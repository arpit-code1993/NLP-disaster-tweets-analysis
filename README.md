Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they're observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e., disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it's not always clear whether a person's words are announcing a disaster.
for example a tweet like "Look at the sky last night it was ablaze"
this is clear for a human right away. But it's less clear to a machine.
